# Email-Autodeleter
A simple yet efficient script to satisfactorily delete 10000+ email from gmail, or in fact any email provider.



# Example usage:

# Run the script, alt+tab into the browser window.
# Place the cursor on the 'Select all' button and press'n' key to capture its coordinates.
# Place the cursor on the 'Delete' button and press 'n' to capture its coordinates.
# Now alt-tab back into the IDE, and replace the point1 and point2 variables with the select and delete coordinates.
# Re-run the script, and alt-tab back into the browser window and press 'p' to start the deletion.

# Change the duration parameter in move_between_points() in order to make the cursor move slower or fatser.
# Use the mouse to take the cursor to the top right corner to break out of the script.
